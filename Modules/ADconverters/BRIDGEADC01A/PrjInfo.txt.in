High sensitivity Bridge Transducer ADC

The module is a complete analog front end for weigh-scale and pressure measurement applications. The device accepts low-level signals directly from a bridge transducer and outputs a serial
digital word on SPI interface.
Exitation voltage could be generated by module itself. Exitation signal is synchronous with internal signal sampling.
