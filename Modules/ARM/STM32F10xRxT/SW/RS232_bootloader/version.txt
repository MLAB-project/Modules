* V2.2.0 - 05/03/2010
=====================

New Features
************
    + Adding support of STM32F1xx Value line and XL density devices
    + Adding support of new STM8L devices 

Enhancements
************
    + Fix of "removes FFs data" when using GUI demo or Command line utility
    + Fix of sending extra "0xFF" or a random byte at the end of flash if sending odd data
    + Fix of RTS and DTR Outputs control in Command line version
    + Fix of special Echo modes for LIN emulation over UART for STM8 while using a tranceiver
    
Known Limitations
*****************
    + Automatic selection of some STM8 devices may not work properly. If required, use 
      command line version with batch files customization.
    + STM32F1xx Write protection of last pages which is controlled by the last protection bit7
      in WPR3 options byte is working properly but the Graphical view of check boxes may not updated
      accordingly on some devices with large size greater than 128Kbytes.
      To enable/disable the write protection of last pages, you can check/uncheck only the first
      page of this group of pages on the graphical view.
