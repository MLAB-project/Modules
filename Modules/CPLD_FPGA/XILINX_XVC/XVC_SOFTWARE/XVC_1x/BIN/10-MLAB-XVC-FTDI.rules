# Rule for unbinding XVC_FT220X device from ftdi_sio driver and setting permissions for everyone
# Put this file to /etc/udev/rules.d

# MLAB Module XVC_FT220X for JTAG programming of Xilinx uses standard VendorID and DeviceID
# of used FTDI chips. Unfortunately on latest Linux there is udev automaticaly loading
# device driver ftdi_sio which creates ttyUSBxx device for any attached FTDI chip.
# This driver prevents XVC program to comunicate with FTDI chip via FT2XX library.
# It is necessary to disconnect (unbind) our FTDI device (identifyed by its name) from
# ftdi_sio driver.
