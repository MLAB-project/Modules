<!--- description --->In is a contactless magnetic position sensor for accurate angular measurement over a full turn of 360 degrees. To measure the angle, only a simple two-pole magnet, rotating over the center of the chip, is required. The absolute angle measurement provides instant indication of the magnet’s angular position with a resolution of 0.0879º. This digital data is available as a serial bit stream.<!--- Edescription --->
