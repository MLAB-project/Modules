# MLAB hardware modules main repository

The MLAB Project was created to develop an universal kit to support hobbyist and professionals in the construction of simple or more complicated devices and instruments (robots, automation systems, testing kits and so on). It is primarily intended for engineers and scientists and it is in continuous development since 2003.

**This repository is only a component of the [complete MLAB system](http://www.mlab.cz/)** 

## Modules

The principle of [Modular LABoratory](http://www.mlab.cz) is based on decomposition of complex systems into smaller cells or bricks (in MLAB called [modules](http://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:moduly)) such as communication interfaces, operational amplifiers, CPU modules, FPGA programmers and many other. Over years of development, [tenths of modules have been created](https://github.com/mlab-modules) - for easier orientation they are sorted into categories which are the first-level folders of this repository. Many modules are included as [repository submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in this parent repository.

When creating modules, great emphasis is put on the quality of design and construction. The results can, therefore, meet the standards of even the most demanding users from the community of researchers, experimenters and innovators.

## How to start using MLAB

Further information can be found on [MLAB Wiki](http://wiki.mlab.cz/).

There is also a [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mlab-users) available for users and developers.

## Compatibility

Thanks to careful design, most of the modules are dimensionally and electrically compatible with many other products. Examples include the Arduino platform, the Merkur construction set, optical tables and DIN switchboard systems.

## Applications

See the [list of designs](http://www.mlab.cz/Server/GenIndex/GenIndex.php?path=%2FDesigns&lang=en) for an illustration of the wide spectrum of possible applications.
